In circumstances in which few questions are needed for the game, it may be possible to extract all of them in a batch without affecting performance and response times. Besides, extracting them this way opens up the possibility of using multiple threads to gather the data, greatly increasing performance. However, if the querying times are too high, this strategy may cause great delays while loading the game. A possible alternative is explained below:

In cases where a lot of questions are needed, or wikidata querying has a great impact on performance, this alternative may prove to be convenient. By distributing the data fetching along the entire match, bottlenecks on performance will be reduced. Depending on the system load, or even on client device's specifications, batch sizes may vary adapting to maintain responsiveness.
