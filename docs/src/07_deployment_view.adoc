In addition to what is shown in the diagram, we will also use Graphana and Prometheus during the production stage as code monitoring systems.

Motivation::

Our goal is to run the application with Docker in a Azure VM.
However, during the production stage, each contributor will deploy the project locally.
Final product will be deployed in http://wiq.sytes.net/ (if that does not work, try http://20.77.37.219:3000/).

Quality and/or Performance Features::
As for performance features, our current Azure MV has 2 GiB RAM and 1vCPU.
If that was not enough, we can always switch to an Oracle VM, which has better resources for free.
MongoDB will be used in both Databases.
