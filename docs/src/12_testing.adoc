== Testing

=== Unit tests
Unit testing is fundamental to ensure application working as intended. Our goal is to have a minimun of 80% of code coverage.
Jest is used as the testing framework due to its simplicity and speed.

=== Acceptance tests
As for acceptance tests, we currently have five scenarios:

* Registering a new user
** Given An unregistered user
** When I fill the data in the form and press submit
** Then A confirmation message should be shown on the screen
* Login with an existing user
** Given A registered user
** When I fill the data in the form and press submit
** Then Menu screen is displayed
* Playing classic game with default settings
** Given A logged user
** When I play with configured settings(2 questions 2 answers)
** Then 2 questions with 2 answers are asked
* Playing calculator game with default settings
** Given A logged user
** When I press play button
** Then questions with 4 answers are displayed till time finishes
* Checking history
** Given A logged user
** When I go to History section
** Then games with questions and answers are shown

=== Load Tests
For load tests, we have been using Gatling with Firefox proxy to simulate a real user experience.
