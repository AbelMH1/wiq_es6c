|React
|It is the most used javascript framework and there is a lot of documentation about it. 
|All of us in the team will have to learn how to use it because we have never worked with it.

|JavaScript
|It is a language we have all used. 
|It is a complex language that can cause us problems while other simpler languages could make our work easier. 

|MongoDB
