== Solution Strategy

=== Technology Decisions

In order to develop the application and adhere to the constraints, we selected the following technologies:

- ReactJS: JavaScript library that streamlines the development of graphical interfaces for web applications.
- TypeScript: Extension of JavaScript, bolstering it with type support for improved development.
- GitHub: Platform offering remote repository services for project development, task management, and version control.
- MongoDB: A non-linear database selected to oversee storage of diverse application contents, with each microservice possessing its dedicated database.
- NodeJS: Facilitates efficient management of asynchronous events, notably beneficial for scalable network applications and database administration.
- Docker: Employed for seamless deployment of the application environment.

=== Top-level Decomposition

==== Diagramming tools

We will use PlantUML and UMLet for creating the documentation's diagrams.

=== Approaches to Achieve Top Quality Goals

[cols="1,2,3"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Scenario | Solution Approach

| Privacy
| Users seek reassurance in the safety and privacy of their data within our app.
| Ensuring user data security and privacy within the application.

| Usability
| Seamless execution of all application functions is crucial for user satisfaction.
| Optimizing usability through the utilization of React.

| Maintainability
| Application architecture must facilitate seamless addition or modification of functionalities with minimal code changes.
| Implementing design patterns and adhering to code conventions to ensure clean and maintainable code. Additionally, prioritizing testing during development for long-term maintainability.

| Scalability
| The application's design must accommodate changes effortlessly throughout its lifecycle.
| Employing a microservices approach to minimize code repetition and enhance understanding of application distribution, ensuring future scalability.

=== Organizational Decisions

We've established the following organizational guidelines:

- *Language*: Adhering to international standards, the project, encompassing code and documentation, will be developed in English as the primary language.
- *Issues:* All deliberations will be documented as issues on GitHub.
- *GitHub Projects:* Employing this tool, we'll plan the application's development process, utilizing GitHub's integrated features for efficient project management in accordance with AGILE methodology.

.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.
